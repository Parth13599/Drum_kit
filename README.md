# Drum_kit
This is a drum Kit website in which we have added event listener to the button and key strokes so that we can know when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on the particular button on your website and can respond to it.
The way it works is : 
We have number of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum set and when we click on any of the buttons then we get a corresponding sound of the drum and in addition we can also use the buttons on the keyboard to click them.
